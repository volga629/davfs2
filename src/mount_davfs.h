/* Public functions. */
/*===================*/

/* Main launches a daemon program that runs a directory and file cache and
   is connected to the WbDAV resource and the kernel file system module.
   It must run setuid root. After forking into  daemon mode it releases root
   permissions permanently. The daemon runs with the uid of the user that owns
   the file system. (If invoked by root and the mounted file system is owned
   by root, the daemon runs as root. This should be avoided.)
   Launching the daemon (and stopping) is done in 5 steps.
   Step 1:
   - Gathering information from command line, configuration files and
     environment.
   - Checking this information for consistency and any errors that would
     prevent successful running of the daemon.
   - Checking whether the the user has permissions to mount.
   - Checking whether the neccessary files and directories for running the
     daemon are available.
   Step 2:
   - The modules for connecting to the kernel, connecting to the WebDAV resource
     and for caching are initialised.
   If an error accurs during step 1 or step 2 an error message is printed and
   the program dies immediately. Clean up is left to the operating system.
   Step 3:
   - Forking into daemon mode.
   - While the daemon (child) writes the pid file and starts reading upcalls
     from the kernel in an endless loop, the parent process tries to mount the
     file system and write an entry into mtab (_PROC_MOUNTS).
   - If an error occurs in one of the processes it sends SIGTERM to the other.
     While the parent just dies, the daemon will run its normal exit code
     (see step 5). In rare cases this might nevertheless leave stale pid files
     or entries in mtab that must be cleaned manually by the administrator.
   - If mounting is successful the parent process exits with success.
   Step 4:
   - Running as daemon.
   Step 5:
   - Terminating.
   - The daemon has set a signal handler for SIGTERM and SIGHUP. If it gets one
     of these signals it tries to unmount the file system and resets the global
     variable keep_on_running. This will terminate the message loop gracefully.
   - If the file system is unmounted (by the umount programm), the message
     loop will terminate gracefully.
   - The close functions of the modules are called, that will clean up the
     cache, save cached information if neccessary and close the connections. */
